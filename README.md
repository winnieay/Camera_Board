Camera and Peripheral Daughter Board 
The Camera and Peripheral Daughter Board is to route video outputs to distinct signal channels. It could provide well-ordered video outputs for the pilot. 
To fully utilize the camera, a servo motor is used to control the rotation of the camera, and an onboard step-down voltage regulator is used to convert 5V from 12V for the servo motor.
